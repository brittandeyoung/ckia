# Reporting a Vulnerability 

Our community take all security vulnerabilities
seriously. Thank you for improving the security of our open source 
software. We appreciate your efforts and responsible disclosure and will
make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

Report security vulnerabilities by emailing the team at:
    
    security@ckia.dev

The lead maintainer will acknowledge your email as soon as possible, and will
send a more detailed response indicating the next steps in 
handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the
team will endeavor to keep you informed of the progress towards a fix, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security vulnerabilities in third-party modules to the person or 
team maintaining the module.
